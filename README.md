horizon-eda-portable
====================
Portable [horizon-eda/horizon: Horizon is a free EDA package](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon)

### Notes
- May be it is due to gtk relying on msys / linux fs emulation, `horizon-eda.exe.Portable.cmd` which overrides Windows environmental variables causes `horizon-eda.exe` fail to start
